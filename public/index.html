        <h3>Players and Cards</h3>
        <p>Sheng Ji game played by four players in fixed teams, with partners facing each other across the table. A standard international pack is used, with red and black jokers, making 54 cards in all. The point values of the cards are as follows:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
            Each King</td>   <td>10 points,</td> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
           <td>Each ten     <td>10 points,</td> 
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>Each five     <td>5 points,</td> 
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>Other cards   <td>no value.</td> 
         </tr>
         </table>
         <h3>Ranking of Cards</h3>
         <p>In each hand there are eighteen trumps: the two jokers, all the cards of a particular suit (the trump suit) and all the cards of a particular rank (the trump rank). The highest trump is the red Joker, second is the black Joker, and third is the card which belongs to both the trump suit and the trump rank. Next come the other three cards of the trump rank, which are equal in status. Finally there are the remaining cards of the trump suit which rank in downwards order A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (omitting the trump rank). The three remaining suits also rank from highest to lowest omitting the trump rank.</p>

         <h3>Declarers and Opponents</h3>
         <p>In each game one team is the Declarers, and the other are the Opponents. The Declarers are the winners of the previous game. Each team's score is expressed as a card rank from two (low) up to Ace (high). In each game the trump rank is the Declarers' current score. Both sides start at two and the winners are the first side whose score goes above Ace.</p>
         <p>In each game, one of the Declarers is designated the starter. They will get to start the first round of the game. Additionally, before the game starts, the starter gets the 6 leftover cards after the cards have been dealed. They then get to choose 6 cards from their own hand to discard. No other players get to see these cards. These cards will become important after the game is finished.</p>

         <h3>The Play</h3>
         <p>During the play, Jokers and cards of the trump rank all count as belonging to the trump suit, not to the suits marked on them. </p>

         <p>Play is in counter-clockwise rotation. In the first round, the first person to play their cards is the starter; in each subsequent round, the first person to play is the winner of the previous round. Each of the other three players in turn must play a card in the same suit as the person who started, unless they have run out of cards of the suit, then they may play any cards in their hand. If playing the trump suit, among trumps of equal rank, the one which is played earliest beats the others. When playing different suits, the trump suit will beat the other suits. If everyone plays different non-trump suits, then the highest card in the suit the first person played wins.</p>

         <p>The goal of the game is to win rounds containing points, that is kings, tens and fives. Whenever the Opponents win a round containing any point cards, they accumulate the amount of points in the cards. When the Declarers win a round, they do not accumulate points but prevent the Opponents from winning points.</p>

         <h3>Scoring</h3>
         <p>The result of the game depends on the number of card points won by the Opponents. This determines which side scores how many points, and who will be the Declarers for the next hand.</p>
         <p>If the Opponents win the last round of the game, any point cards in the discard pile get added to the Opponents' points. Moreover, the value of each point card in the discard pile is doubled.</p>
